Merlin is a functional dynamic programming system in the Lisp
family. It's designed and intended for a low-ceremony,
refactoring-based, exploratory approach to writing software. World
domination wasn't a design goal; if your tastes in programming
languages differ from mine, you have my sincerest condolences for
your misfortune. The implementation is in its early embryonic
stages.

**NOTE:** This page reflects the current state of the language. It
is a work in progress, and these pages are subject to sudden and
apocalyptic change with no notice.
