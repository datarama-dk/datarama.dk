* In a sane language, [this function](http://php.net/manual/en/function.uopz-overload.php) would be named `ia_ia_cthulhu_fhtagn()` or `launch_ALL_the_missiles()`.
* Bill Paxton is the only actor who's been killed by both [an Alien, a Predator and a Terminator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHg6S4AYlb4). Lance Henriksen also gets mentioned for that particular honour, but I call shenanigans: His character got maimed, but never killed, by the Alien.
