datarama.dk
===========
This repository contains the sources for my personal
website, `datarama.dk`. Specifically, it contains: 

* The Markdown-formatted Plutonium files
* Image originals (SVG, XCF and PNG formats)
* Webfonts (subsets based on Libertine, Voltaire and Inconsolata)
* CSS file
* SXML templates

It's basically my public notebook, or "static wiki" if you
will. Pages get revised if and when I'm not happy with
them, although I try to avoid renaming URLs whenever
possible â€” doing so contributes directly to link rot, and
hence to the sum misery of the Universe. I write the pages
using Vim, using the excellent Vimwiki plugin to link and
navigate my source pages. Internal links are
bidirectional, so that each page has a "Related Pages"
sidebar section with all pages that link to it. The HTML
is generated using
[Plutonium](https://github.com/datarama-dk/plutonium), a
Scheme-based custom static HTML generator I wrote for the
purpose.
