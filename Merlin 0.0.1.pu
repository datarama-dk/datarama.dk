%subtitle Core Language Interpreter

This release implements the Merlin core, a small functional language
based on s-expressions. The language is dynamically typed,
statically scoped, purely functional and features strict evaluation.
The current core provides:

* Lists
* Atoms (symbols and numbers)
* Primitive functions (`pfun`s)
* User-defined functions (`ufun`s)
* A basic quotation mechanism
* A small collection of special forms: define, if, let, and, or, let, Î»

It's implemented as a simple interpreter, written in
[Gauche](http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/) Scheme. The only 
purpose of this interpreter is to host the development of the 
(JavaScript-targeted) compiler that is to become the main
implementation. I wanted to have a simple (but inefficient and 
stripped-down) implementation ready as quickly as possible, so I 
could do the rest of the Merlin implementation in Merlin itself.

In other words, this is a throwaway interpreter. Don't expect much
from it.
