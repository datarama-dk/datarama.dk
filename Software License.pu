It's essentially a simplified version of the 
[zlib license](http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib), except that I've
removed some redundant language about non-legal wishes, and disambiguated
the second clause. I don't care if or how you "plainly mark" your
modified versions; as long as you're not claiming I wrote your crap,
you're fine.

If you use my software for something interesting, I'd like to hear about
it and I'd love it if you credit me, but the above license represents the
only legal demands I have on the use of my software.
